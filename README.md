> Dogmate is a project which helps you get to know new people and stay in touch with the ones you know during walks with your dogs. Plan your walks, join other people, and their dogs.

This is a frontend app of our Dogmate project. You won't be able to log in, or register
without [the backend](https://github.com/sforaaleksander/dogmate).

## Usage

Run the following command at the root of your project:

```sh
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### After running [the backend](https://github.com/sforaaleksander/dogmate) of our application you can:

* Check available endpoints go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/.

* Login as one of two predefined users:
    - email: `user@user.com`    password: `user`
    - email: `admin@admin.com`  password: `admin`

* Register new user.

* After logging in, you can access the functionality we have already written. Keep in mind the work is still in
  progress.
